### 3. Share Credentials Separately

**DO NOT send credentials in the same message!**

Share these via secure channel (Signal, encrypted email, password manager):

- **Supabase URL:** `https://jdntczidspqkmtnwuxdb.supabase.co`
- **Supabase Anon Key:** (Get from Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API)
- **Admin Password:** (Whatever you set in your admin/.env.local)
- **Optional - Stripe Keys:** (If testing payments)
- **Optional - AWS Credentials:** (If using email features)

## ✅ Verification

You can verify everything is working by:

1. **Visit your repository:**
   https://github.com/Blindldev/ink-letter-books

2. **Test clone (in a different directory):**
   ```bash
   cd /tmp
   git clone https://github.com/Blindldev/ink-letter-books.git
   ls ink-letter-books
   ```

3. **Check that sensitive files are NOT visible:**
   - `.env.local` files should NOT be in the repo ✅
   - `.db-credentials` should NOT be in the repo ✅

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. ✅ Repository created
2. ✅ Code pushed
3. 📤 Send repository URL to collaborator
4. 📤 Send `MESSAGE_FOR_COLLABORATOR.txt` content
5. 🔐 Share credentials separately

**You're all set!** 🎉
